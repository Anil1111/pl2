# Ex.2 Implementing abstract data types (Stack and Queue)

- Create a solution with Console application and Class Library (dll) named (AdtLib).
- Add interfaces and classes as shown in class diagram below.
- Implement Stack and Queue methods using integer array initialized to fixed size (passed into ctors).
	- Before adding element into stack/queue, check if it is full, in case it is throw ApplicationException (Stack/Queue overflow).
	- Before removing element into stack/queue, check if it is empty, in case it is throw ApplicationException (Stack/Queue empty).
- Test your Stack and Queue in Main method of your Console app
- Try to change your implementation with use of nullable data source
- Test your Stack and Queue in Main method of your Console app
